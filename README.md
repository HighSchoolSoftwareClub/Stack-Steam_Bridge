# Stack-Steam_Bridge
A bridge project between StackExchange Chat and Steam Chat. Allows chatting ingame.

##How to install:

First, [download compiled binaries](https://github.com/ardaozkal/Stack-Steam_Bridge/releases) or compile the source yourself.

Create a file called "config.ini" at the same folder as the binaries (sample is included in both compiled binaries and source), add these information in each line:

    StackExchange Mail Address
    StackExchange Password
    Steam Username (not your main- you can't message yourself, create an alt, no need for getting any games etc, you'll need to add the alt from your main though)
    Steam Password
    SteamID2 of your main Steam Account (get it [here](http://steamidfinder.com/))
    Link of chatroom (example: http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1/sandbox)

Launch the executable. It takes some time to load, once the bot is online, you can start chatting.
